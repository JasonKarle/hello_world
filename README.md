# hello_world
My very first repository, following the GitHub guide ---- being a good community member, and hoping to make as few silly mistakes as possible!

Hello! As line 2 above mentions, I am working through the community guide so that I can learn how to properly use GitHub.

I am currently learning Python and Tkinter so I can develop some basic program ideas I have (emphasis on *basic*!) 
with the goal of improving my programming literacy.

Any program I hang on GitHub is open to CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, with emphasis on following language conventions, and
code efficiencies.
